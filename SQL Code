--2018 NYC Central Park Squirrel Census Data Exploration
--Coded By Sterling James


--Lets view our dataset!
  SELECT *  
  FROM `squirrels-398520.squirrel_data.squirrels` 
  ORDER BY Park_ID

--Looks like we can ask some interesting questions here!
--Let's start with a simple one.
-What do most squirrels spend their time doing?
  SELECT Activities, COUNT(*)
  FROM `squirrels-398520.squirrel_data.squirrels` 
  WHERE Activities IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY Activities
  ORDER BY 2 DESC

--Looks like most squrriels, 94 counted occurances, spend their time foraging!
--Lets try something a little trickier!
--Lets see if squirrels that are willing to approach people are more likely to be eating than those who are less socially inclined.

--First up is finding the friendly squirrels!
 SELECT Activities, COUNT(*) AS friendly_squirrels
FROM `squirrels-398520.squirrel_data.squirrels` 
WHERE 
  Interactions_with_Humans LIKE '%Approaches%' 
  OR Interactions_with_Humans LIKE '%Friendly%' 
  AND Activities LIKE '%Eating%'
GROUP BY Activities
ORDER BY 2 DESC

--Now we need the anti-social squirrels
  SELECT Activities, COUNT (*) AS Antisocial_Squirrels
  FROM `squirrels-398520.squirrel_data.squirrels` 
  WHERE 
    Interactions_with_Humans NOT LIKE '%Approaches%' 
    AND Interactions_with_Humans NOT LIKE '%Friendly%'
    AND Activities LIKE '%Eating%'
  GROUP BY Activities
  ORDER BY 2 DESC

--Alright, these queries indicate that of the friendly squirrels 13 are recorded as eating and of the anti-social squirrels a whopping 49 are recorded as eating. 
--This is clearly a win for the introverted folks among us! 
--Or more likely its due to there being far more anti-social squirrels than friendly squirrels.

--With that answered i'm personally curious to see which parks have the most squirrel sightings!
--This one is pretty easy!
  SELECT Park_Name, COUNT (*) AS Squirrel_Sightings
  FROM `squirrels-398520.squirrel_data.squirrels` 
  GROUP BY Park_Name
  ORDER BY 2 DESC

--This tells us that Tompkins Square Park has the most recorded sightings at 59!

--I hope you enjoyed this basic exploration of squirrel data!
